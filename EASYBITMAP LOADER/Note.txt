This code provide easy way to draw a bitmap (24bit and 32bit bmp file) on the window console.
This file has the pure algorithm of how to draw a bitmap file on the conosole with pure c++.
(only window.h used for SetPixel function to draw point on console)
How to use.
1. EBMP bmp; //Create EBMP class
2. bmp.BITMAP(file direction); // using BITMAP function convert the BITMAP FILE
3. Bitmap_reader(bmp, x, y); // using the rendering function drawing bmp file on console (x,y is based on the lower left  corner)

Future work
1. This version is using the SetPixel function of window API.
I am trying to find alternative way to draw pixel on console.
