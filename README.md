#Google, Youtube and Github are my teachers.
#I am learnning coding by myself, 
#So I focused on writing computer coding in a way that is as easy to understand as possible.
#I wrote the code so that I could go from the basics to the next, 
#while minimizing the use of the API for studying rather than possible omissions.
#Although this seems to be inefficient, 
#I try to write as much as possible for the composition and association of the codes.
#Please note that the names of various variables are deliberately long.
